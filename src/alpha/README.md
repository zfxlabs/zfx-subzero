# alpha

The `alpha` chain defines all chains known to nodes in the network and implements `Proof-ofStake`.

The `alpha` chain, once bootstrapped, enables `sleet` consensus to begin. `sleet` is a sybil resistant consensus which extends `ice` with additional information about participating nodes on the network.
