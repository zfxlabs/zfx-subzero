# zfx-subzero

The `zfx-subzero` project is a unification of the core products which `zero.fx` has been working on throughout the year into a unified whole.

# ice

A `O(1)` reservoir sampling based consensus algorithm for transiently establishing the liveness of peers and performing a safe network bootstrap. 

Once the `alpha` chain is instantiated, `ice` becomes sybil resistant and is augmented with information about peers such as the stake `weight` and `uptime`.

# hail

A consensus algorithm with similar properties as `Avalanche` but specialised to blocks.

# alpha

The root chain of the `zero.fx` network. 

# beta

`beta` is a phantom chain containing block headers.

# bridge
